## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
There are many ways to position the profile picture between two divs. One of the ways to accomplish it is to use negative values for the margin-top: 

.card-profile-frame {
    margin: -50px auto 20px;
}

### Continued development

CSS Positioning is an art but I am still learning how to position elements in css. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjObtWO5RvU&t=1314s&ab_channel=CodingSections) - This helped me for positioning the profile picture
